By combining various type operators, we can express complex operations 
and values in a succinct, maintainable way. In this section weâ€™ll cover
ways to express a new type in terms of an existing type or value.

 - Generics - Types which take parameters
 - Keyof Type Operator - Using the keyof operator to create new types
 - Typeof Type Operator - Using the typeof operator to create new types
 - Indexed Access Types - Using Type['a'] syntax to access a subset of a type
 - Conditional Types - Types which act like if statements in the type system
 - Mapped Types - Creating types by mapping each property in an existing type
 - Template Literal Types - Mapped types which change properties via template literal strings
