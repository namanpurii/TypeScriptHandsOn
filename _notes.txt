TypeScript compatible Transpilers: 

Tools like Babel, swc and Sucrase can transpile your TS files to JS for speed and 
consistency with your existing building tools. These handle file conversion but do
not handle the type-checking aspects of the TypeScript compiler (tsc). So it's likely
that you will still need to keep the above TypeScript dependency around, and you will
want to enable isolatedModules.

What is TypeScript ?

 - Javascript is a dynamically typed language that is the types of a variable are 
   inferred at the run-time. This makes JS difficult to work with as it makes it slower
   to compile as compared to its statically typed counterparts like C++, Java, etc. Also,
   makes room for gazillion errors that are never caught if not at the runtime itself.

 - Typescript brings the power of static typing to Javascript by checking types at the
   compile time and raising errors which is not native to vanilla JS. At the same time, 
   doesnt affect the output of your intended JS code because eventually the typescript
   compiler not only checks for any type errors and most native JS runtime errors at 
   runtime but also transpiles your TS code to equivalent JS code(CommonJS or ESM is configurable)

Interfaces in TypeScript:

In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible. This 
allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without
an explicit implements clause.
